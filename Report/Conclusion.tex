\chapter{Conclusion}
Today, wind farms created by Siemens Wind Power has a centralized setup. Two central nodes exist in the wind farms, the Park Pilot and the Wind Power Supervisor. The Park Pilot is responsible for regulation of the power production of every turbine and for regulating the power production of the wind farm itself. The Wind Power Supervisor is responsible for data storage and external communication. The centralized approach to wind farm control poses a number of challenges for Siemens Wind Power.

The first challenge is a problem of scalability. The Park Pilot does not scale well with the number of turbines. This forces Siemens Wind Power to install several Park Pilots in one wind farm in order to properly regulate the power production of the turbines and the wind farm itself.

The second challenge is a problem of availability. Using centralized components as the Park Pilot and the Wind Power Supervisor introduces single points of failure in the wind farm. If a Park Pilot or the Wind Power Supervisor unexpectedly breaks down, parts of the wind farm are no longer available.

Thus, Siemens Wind Power wishes to increase the scalability and the availability of the wind farm setup by decentralizing the Park Pilots and the Wind Power Supervisor, such that their functionality is placed in the turbines.

In order to investigate the feasibility of decentralizing the Park Pilots and the Wind Power Supervisor the two components has been analyzed to identify the key services they provide.

The key service of the Park Pilots is to communicate with the turbines in order to regulate their accumulated power production according to the power production goal of the wind farm. Thus, to decentralize the Park Pilots the turbines must be able to communicate such that each turbine's power production can be regulated according to the power production goal of the wind farm without a centralized Park Pilot.

The key services of the Wind Power Supervisor is to facilitate external communication and to aggregate and calculate aggregate values for the wind farm. Thus, to decentralize the Wind Power Supervisor the turbines must be able to facilitate external communication as well as data aggregation across the wind farm.

Components able to provide decentralized communication, decentralized external communication and dezentralized data aggregation and storage in a decentralized environment has been identified. For decentralized communication between turbines the Data Distribution Service for Real Time Systems (DDS) is recommended. DDS supports communication using the publish/subscribe paradigm without a centralized broker. Furthermore, DDS is able to use multicast for transmission of network packages which limits the number of packages in the network thereby increasing the scalability of DDS. For decentralized external communication Linux Virtual Server Project (LVS) is recommended. LVS is built into the Linux kernel and is capable of redirecting traffic on the data-link layer. This makes for an outstanding performance in terms of connections handled per second. Similarly LVS facilitates direct communication between the turbine that is redirected to and the external connection initiator. For data storage and data aggregation MongoDB is recommended. MongoDB is able to scale horizontally as well as do replication of data such that in the event of a turbine failure data is not lost. MongoDB supports sharding of a database which is important as the data aggregated across the wind farm will accumulate to a size that no single turbine is able to store.

Using the identified components above we conclude that it is feasible to decentralize the current wind farm setup of a Siemens Wind Power wind farm.

Decentralizing the Park Pilots and the Wind Power Supervisor is expected to increase the availability of the wind farm. This puts certain requirements on the power regulation of the turbines, DDS, LVS and MongoDB.

Experiments show that the proposed decentralized solution is able to maintain wind farm power production in the face of turbine failures. Should a turbine become unavailable the remaining turbines are regulated such that they increase their power production in order to compensate for the unavailable turbine. Thus, internal communication handled by DDS is able to continue despite turbine failure.

LVS and MongoDB has not been implemented in the proposed decentralized solution, but they have been chosen partly because of their ability to uphold availability in a decentralized setup. LVS has the ability to detect load balancer failure by monitoring heartbeats from the load balancer that is currently handling external connections. Should the heartbeats cease to be sent another load balancer can take over and continue operation, by handling new external requests. MongoDB is capable of replication of databases across nodes. Thus, data collected on one turbine can be replicated to a number of other turbines. Should a turbine become unavailable the data collected on the unavailable turbine will still be accessible because it is replicated to other turbines.

By the experiment performed and the abilities of maintaining operation in spite of node failure of LVS and MongoDB, we conclude that removing one or more turbines from the system at runtime will not cause system failure. Decentralizing the current wind farm setup of a Siemens Wind Power wind farm will increase availability by removing the single points of failure embodied by the Park Pilots and the Wind Power Supervisor. By introducing failure resistant components capable of providing the same services as the Park Pilots and the Wind Power Supervisor the availability of the wind farm will be further increased.
