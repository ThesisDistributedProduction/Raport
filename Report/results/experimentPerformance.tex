\textit{Can we create a solution that scales such that the number of turbines does not impact the regulation cycle time?}

\subsection{Experiments}
\label{sec:Exper:perfom}

%Scalability is by Bondi\cite{Bondi:2000:CSI:350391.350432} defined as \textit{the systems ability to accommodate an increasing number of elements or objects, to process growing volumes of work gracefully, and/or to be susceptible to enlargement}.

The \ref{PS:Q:Performance} problem address if the proposed decentralized solution is able to keep a constant regulation cycle time independent from the number of turbines. This problem operates in a 3-dimensional space with regulation cycle time (ms), number of cache reads and number of turbines as parameters. To study the correlation between the parameters, we isolate two parameters by making the third constant.

Thus to fully address \ref{PS:Q:Performance} this experiment has been divided into two experiments:
 
\begin{description}
	\item[Experiment 1] aims to investigate the anti-correlation between the implemented sleep time of the regulation cycle and the number of cache reads for the decentralized system. This is relevant because changing the sleep time is expected to impact the number of cache reads, since an increase in sleep time increases the time Connext has to overwrite received states, thus decreasing the number of cache reads (as explained in \cref{sec:cachereads}). Thus the constant for this is experiment is the number of turbines.
	\item[Experiment 2] aims to investigate the impact on the regulation cycle time and the number of cache reads when increasing the number of turbines in the decentralized solution, and thus answer the \ref{PS:Q:Performance} problem. The constant for this experiment is the sleep time.
\end{description}

The cycle regulation time of the decentralized solution is defined as the difference between the receive timestamp of the oldest turbine state(tOldestState) received and the timestamp sampled right after, a new turbine state has been sent (tSent) (as illustrated on \cref{fig:timingDecentral}):

$$regulation~cycle~time=tSent-tOldestState$$

\begin{figure}[b]
	\input{figures/tikz/timingDiagramDecntral}
	\caption{Decentralized regulation time}
	\label{fig:timingDecentral}
\end{figure}

The timestamp of the oldest turbine state is used to include network traffic in the regulation cycle time, as opposed to just sampling the time locally. Thus, if the decentralized solution is using cached data this will be reflected in the regulation cycle time. Note that by this definition, it is possible for regulation cycle time to be lower than the sleep time, even though the sleep operation is a part of the regulation cycle. 


\subsection{Experiment 1: How sleep time impacts the regulation cycle time and the number of cache reads}
\label{subsec:Exper:perfom:1}
The purpose of this experiment is to show how the sleep time affects the number of cache reads and the regulation cycle time for the decentralized solution (see \cref{sec:cachereads} for cache reads description).  
The experiment is performed with cycle time t=\testCycletimeNumbers.  

The following procedure is used each time the experiment is performed:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Start the system with a cycle time of t ms and 50 turbines.
	\item Make sure the system is stable.
	\item Start logging the regulation cycle time and the number of cache reads.
	\item Stop logging after 50 seconds.
\end{enumerate}

50 seconds of logging provided 59000 data samples as the lowest amount of data samples for a single data set (the data set using 50 ms sleep time). Thus each data set of this experiment has been plotted using 59000 data samples.

\subsection{Experiment 2: How the number of turbines impacts the regulation cycle time and the number of cache reads}
\label{subsec:Exper:perfom:2}
The purpose of this experiment is to answer the \ref{PS:Q:Performance} problem, by showing how the number of turbines affects the regulation cycle time for the decentralized solution. To complete the picture we also investigate how the number of turbines affects the cache reads, since an expected side effect of increasing the number of turbines also increases the number of cache reads as described in \cref{sec:cachereads}.

The experiments are performed with n=\testTurbineNumbers ~turbines. The sleep time is set to 20 ms and is constant for this experiment.

The test system is expected to be running only one instance in a real life implementation, therefore the machine logging the data will only run one instance and the supporting machines will run the rest, generating system load.

The following procedure is used each time the experiment is performed:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Start the system with n turbines.
	\item Make sure the system is stable.
	\item Start logging the reported regulation run time and the number of cache reads.
	\item Stop logging after 50 seconds.
\end{enumerate}

50 seconds of logging provided 14500 data samples as the lowest amount of data samples for a single data set (the data using 5 turbines). Thus each data set of this experiment has been plotted using 14500 data samples.

\subsection{Results} \label{sec:exp:performance}

We use the following box plot type (for \cref{fig:exp:decen:sleep} and \cref{fig:exp:decen:turbines}): The central mark is the median, the edges of the box are the 25th and 75th percentiles, the whiskers extend to the most extreme data points not considered outliers, and outliers are plotted individually. The whisker length is denoted as 1.5 IQR.

\end{figure}

\Cref{fig:exp:decen:sleep} show that the regulation cycle time and sleep time are linearly dependent. Outliers are focused around the boxes with the exception of the 10 ms data point. The 10 ms data point has box edges further apart from each other than other data points. This is caused by having too many turbine instances running on the same PC's, thus stressing the experiment equipment (see \cref{sec:hardwareSepc} for hardware specification) too much, which causes package delays. Hence the 10 ms data point should be disregarded.

\end{figure}

\FloatBarrier

\Cref{fig:exp:decen:sleep-cache} show that the average cache reads is declining when increasing the sleep time. As described in \cref{sec:cachereads}, cache reads only indicates if a given state has been read before, thus the number does not increase with the number of times the same state has been read. Again, the 10 ms data point should be disregarded due to limitations of the test setup.

\end{figure}

\Cref{fig:exp:decen:turbines} shows how the regulation cycle time of the decentralized solution changes with the number of turbines.
When the number of turbines reach 85, the distribution of datapoints starts to widen. The outliers take on more extreme values as well. This can be explained by limitations in the test setup. Thus, results from 85 turbines to 100 turbines are to be disregarded.

Looking at data points from from 5 to 80 turbines, the median of the regulation cycle time is nearly constant.
The quartiles are with the exception of the 5 turbines experiment of almost constant until 80 turbines. The upper outliers are focused around the quartiles until 60 turbines. The lower outliers are more inconsistent and less focused around the quartiles.
The outliers span from 0 ms to 150 ms of regulation cycle time.

\end{figure}


\Cref{fig:exp:decen:turbines_cache} shows the change in average cache reads when the number of turbines increase. The number of cache reads are below 4 from 5 turbines to 80 turbines, with an increasing trend. From 85 turbines to 95 turbines the number of cache reads increase with an exponential tendency. This can again be explained by limitations in the test setup, and the results should be disregarded.
        
        
\subsection{Discussion} 
The decentralized solution aims to detach the regulation cycle time from the number of turbines, by making reception of turbine state happen in parallel with the regulation cycle. As a consequence of this the term cache reads has been introduced to the system, since the detaching of receiving states from the regulation cycle opens for the possibility, that a given state from a turbine is used multiple times for regulation. 

Looking at Experiment 1, we disregard the 10 ms data sets for both \cref{subsec:Exper:perfom:1} and \cref{fig:exp:decen:sleep-cache}, due to limited experiment equipment. Running with a 10 ms sleep time, caused our experiment setup to approach maximum network adapter capacity, due to too many packages in the network, thus resulting in package delays, obscuring the experiment results.

Looking at \cref{fig:exp:decen:sleep} we observe a linearly dependency between the sleep time and the regulation cycle time (with the 10 ms data set disregarded). This is expected since the sleep operation is a part of the regulation cycle. 

From \cref{fig:exp:decen:sleep-cache} we observe that the average cache reads appears to be independent from the sleep time and thus constant. However if we include the disregarded sleep time of 10 ms, we observe that the number of cache reads increase when the experiment setup approaches maximum capacity. This is caused by the package delays, forcing each turbine to read old states, thus demonstrating the decentralized solutions ability to decrease the sleep time at the expense of allowing cache reads, if desired. This is observed by \cref{fig:exp:decen:turbines_cache} as well. 

Looking at Experiment 2, we disregard the 85 to 100 data sets for both \cref{fig:exp:decen:turbines} and \cref{fig:exp:decen:turbines_cache}, due to limited experiment equipment. For this experiment, one computer is used for logging and two computers for simulating turbines, thus, when simulating 80 turbines, 40 turbines are run on the same computer. Running with over 40 turbines, forces the experiment equipment used to approach maximum CPU capacity, thus resulting in package delays, obscuring the experiment results.

Looking at \cref{fig:exp:decen:turbines} we see that the decentralized solution's regulation cycle time seems to be independent from the number of turbines. From 5 to 80 turbines the regulation cycle time is nearly constant at 20 ms.
The near constant regulation cycle time is caused by the fact that the regulation cycle in the decentralized solution is not forced to wait for data, before running the regulation algorithm, because data is continually received in parallel with the regulation cycle. Thus for the regulation cycle time, adding a turbine to the system only means an increase in the number of turbines that needs to be processed in the regulation algorithm, thus only a tiny increase in CPU time, to the point that the network bandwidth and the network adapters allows.

The amount of outliers in \cref{fig:exp:decen:turbines} and \cref{fig:exp:decen:sleep} is fairly high. This is to be expected as the regulation cycle time factors in network traffic. The outliers that is higher than the regulation cycle time are cache reads, since these data points are older than the sleep time, thus from the previous regulation cycle (disregarding calculation CPU time) and can be explained by a delay or a loss of packages in the network. Another explanation could be that the turbines are not running synchronized with each other. This means that one turbine may receive states from other turbines, just at the time when the sleep time of the regulation cycle time elapses. Thus, it is possible that some turbines may not deliver their states in time for them to be used in the current regulation cycle, which forces the use of cache reads, which in turn increases the regulation cycle time.

The outliers with lower values than the median, means we observe a lower regulation cycle time than the sleep time. This happens if the decentralized solution receives a new state from all turbines during the sleep operation, and is possible due to our definition of the regulation cycle time including network traffic (i.e. calculated using the timestamp of the oldest state).
