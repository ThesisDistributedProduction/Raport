\section{PS:Q:Scalability}



\subsection{Experiment}
\label{subsec:Exper:Scale}
Question \ref{PS:Q:Scalability} of \cref{sec:problemStatement} asks how the proposed decentralized system compares to the existing centralized system\cref{cha:existingSystem}) at Siemens Wind Power with regards to a number of parameters.
The experiments below aims to show how the number of turbines and regulation speed affect the regulation algorithm, memory consumption and Network traffic.
Each of these parameters behave differently when centralized compared to decentralized as seen in \cref{fig:timingCentralVSDecentral} the decentralized system does not wait for new data before doing calculations. Because of this the proposed decentralized version has a extra parameter which indicate how much data was updated before the calculation started.

	\label{fig:timingCentralVSDecentral}
\end{figure}

	The centralized version is split into two applications a client and a server.
	The aim is to compare the regulation time, therefore the client side of the application is not measured. This means that the decentralized version is at a slight disadvantage.
	The following procedure is used each time the experiment is done, the procedure is done with N simulated turbines for both :

\begin{minipage}{\textwidth}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Start the system with N turbines.
		\item Make sure the system is stable.
		\item Start logging:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Reported regulation run time (Central only, Decentralized is reused)
			\item Memory and Bandwidth
		\end{itemize}
		\item Stop logging after \experiemntRunTime.
		\end{enumerate}
\end{minipage}


\subsection{Results}

\begin{figure}[h!]

	\input{figures/tikz/results/Test4_Central_cycle}
	\caption{Centralized solution variable number of turbines experiment 1}
	\label{fig:exp:cen:turbines}
\end{figure}

The \nameref{subsec:Exper:Scale} experiment results are described in this section, these experiments are done against the centralized solution. \Cref{fig:exp:cen:turbines} show the comparison experiment done with the centralized solution. The median values initially are constant, this is from 10 turbines to 30 turbines, from 35 and up the median is linearly increasing.
From 70 Turbines the regulation start to have larger max values which increases linearly as well.
