\textit{Will the regulation cycle time of the new decentralized solution scale better than the current Siemens system in terms of number of turbines per Park Pilot?}\newline\newline

\noindent As mentioned in \cref{cha:existingSystem} the centralized solution is a simulation of the current Siemens system. Thus to complete the comparison between the decentralized solution and the current Siemens system, the discussion section of this experiment also contains a discussion with regards to differences between the centralized solution and the current Siemens system (described in \cref{sec:CenAndCurrentSiemensSystemComparison}).

\subsection{Experiment}
\label{subsec:Exper:Scale}

The \ref{PS:Q:Scalability} problem asks for a comparison between the decentralized solution and the current Siemens system, in order to determine which of the systems scales best, in terms of decreasing the coupling between the regulation cycle time and the number of turbines. For this experiment we compare the results of the \ref{PS:Q:Performance} problem with acquired results from the centralized solution. Thus for this comparison, we study how the regulation cycle time changes when increasing the number of turbines for both systems.

\end{figure}

The regulation cycle time of the decentralized solution is defined as the difference between the receive timestamp of the oldest turbine state (tOldestState) received and the timestamp sampled right after, a new turbine state has been sent (tSent):

$$regulation~cycle~time=tSent-tOldestState$$

The timestamp of the oldest turbine state is used to include network traffic in the regulation cycle time. Thus, if the decentralized solution is using cached data this will be reflected in the regulation cycle time, making the comparison between the centralized and decentralized solution more fair. 
%The aim is to compare the regulation cycle time including , therefore the turbine side centralized solution is not measured. This means that the decentralized version is at a slight disadvantage, since .

We use the following box plot type (for \cref{fig:exp:decen:sleep} and \cref{fig:exp:decen:turbines}): The central mark is the median, the edges of the box are the 25th and 75th percentiles, the whiskers extend to the most extreme data points not considered outliers, and outliers are plotted individually. The whisker length is denoted as 1.5 IQR. 

The following procedure is used each time the experiment is performed:

\begin{minipage}{\textwidth}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Start the system with N turbines.
		\item Make sure the system is stable.
		\item Start logging regulation cycle time.
		\item Stop logging after \experiemntRunTime.
		\end{enumerate}
\end{minipage}

\end{figure}

\Cref{fig:exp:cen:turbines} shows how the number of turbines influence the regulation cycle time of the centralized solution.
For every number of turbines 450 data points have been sampled. The reason for the limited amount of samples is that when running the experiment with 95 turbines the test setup is reaching it's limits. Data transfer speeds of up to 75 Mbit/s was observed. Since the maximum theoretical data transfer speed of the test setup is 100 Mbit/s it is reasonable to assume that a number of packages have been lost due to congestion. Thus, the experiment for 95 turbines only managed to log 450 data samples within the given experiment time. In order to create a boxplot with comparable values the sample set for each number of turbines was reduced to the 450 first points.
The limited amount of data samples account for the "holes" between outlier values. With more data samples these holes would be filled such that outliers are more evenly distributed from the top whisker to the most extreme outlier.

The median values from 5 to 30 turbines is increasing slightly. From 35 turbines and onward the median is linearly increasing.
From 75 turbines onward the outliers take on increasingly extreme values, which is when the test setup starts to be unable to handle the number of packages sent in the network. Results from 75 turbines and onward should be disregarded.

\subsection{Discussion}
The test results from the centralized solution presented in \cref{fig:exp:cen:turbines} shows how adding turbines increases the regulation cycle time. From 5 to 30 turbines the regulation time of the centralized solution increase slowly. After 35 turbines the increase in regulation cycle time becomes steeper. For every 15 turbines added the regulation cycle time increases with approximately $25 ms$. The relation between regulation cycle time and the number of turbines is caused by the direct impact the number of turbines have on the regulation cycle. The Park Pilot of the centralized solution must use additional time on querying each added turbine as well as wait for their individual reply before performing the regulation algorithm. Thus the scalability of the centralized solution is linear with a factor of approximately $25 / 15 = 1.667$ ms added regulation cycle time per added turbine.
The outliers of \cref{fig:exp:cen:turbines} is distributed fairly close around the medains from 5 to 70 turbines. From 75 turbines on the outliers quadruple in regulation cycle time which is a sign that the test setup has reached it's limits. The heavily increased regulation cycle time for the outliers is a result of lost or delayed network packages forcing the Park Pilot to wait for a retransmission of turbine state before the regulation cycle can be completed.

\subsubsection{Comparison of the decentralized solution and the centralized solution}
\label{sec:comp:decentralizedVScentralized}
The decentralized solution and the centralized solution is built with a very different architecture. This is reflected in the difference in the way the two solutions scale with the number of turbines.

\cref{fig:exp:cenVSDecen} shows the medians of \cref{fig:exp:decen:turbines,fig:exp:cen:turbines} where data that has been disregarded previously has been removed. Thus, the maximum number of turbines in \cref{fig:exp:cenVSDecen} is 70. 

\begin{figure}[h!]
	\centering
	\input{results/matlab/Decen5VSCent4}	
	\caption{The centralized solution's median values compared with the decentralized solution's median values}
	\label{fig:exp:cenVSDecen}
\end{figure}

Looking at \cref{fig:exp:cenVSDecen} we see that the centralized and decentralized solutions scale very differently.
The decentralized solution scales constant with number of turbines from 5 to 70 turbines. The centralized solution scales linearly with the number of turbines from 5 to 30 turbines and from 30 to 70 turbines with a steeper slope. With the test setup used and a sleep time in the decentralized solution's regulation cycle at 20 ms the centralized solution scales better than the decentralized solution from 5 to 50 turbines. The decentralized solution scales better than the centralized solution from 50 to 70 turbines.
If the sleep time of the regulation cycle in the decentralized solution is lowered to for instance 10 ms the decentralized solution would scale better than the centralized solution from 38 turbines on. Lowering the sleep time of the regulation cycle in the decentralized solution will make the chance of cache reads increase as illustrated in \cref{fig:exp:decen:sleep-cache}.

As the test setup imposes limits on the number of turbines that can be simulated it is not possible to say anything concrete about how the scalability of the centralized and decentralized solution will be for any number of turbines higher than 70.
A qualified guess about the scalability can be provided though. The scalability of the centralized solution is expected to keep scaling linearly with the number of turbines. The decentralized solution will keep scaling with the number of turbines but as the number of turbines increase so will the number of cache reads. If the number of cache reads increases this will be reflected in the regulation cycle time. Thus, the scalability of the decentralized solution will not keep scaling at a constant level but the impact of increased cache reads remains to be further investigated.



\FloatBarrier

%The scalability of the centralized solution is linear with a factor of approximately $1.667$ ms added to regulation cycle time per turbine added to the system.
%The scalability of the decentralized solution, as described in \cref{sec:disc:turbinesVScycletime}, is small enough that it is indistinguishable from other factors in our test data and therefore we cannot calculate it. Thus the scalability of the decentralized solution is close to constant. This great improvement in scalability comes with a trade off in terms of cache reads. Adding additional turbines to the decentralized solution the number of cache reads increases with a factor of $0.033$ extra cache reads per added turbine which is still an improvement compared to the scale factor of the centralized solution. Arguably comparing the scalability of the number of cache reads in the decentralized solution with the scalability of the regulation cycle in the centralized solution is not a viable way to compare the scalability of the two solutions, but comparing the scalability of the regulation cycle of both solutions will not be a fair comparison either since the improvements in scalability of the decentralized solution comes at the price of increased numbers of cache reads.

\subsubsection{Comparison of the decentralized solution and the current Siemens system}
This section address the \ref{PS:Q:Scalability} problem of \cref{sec:problemStatement}.
Comparing the decentralized solution and the current Siemens system directly is impossible given the differences in environment and architecture. Introducing a centralized solution is an attempt to bridge this gap. By comparing the decentralized solution to the centralized solution and measuring the improvements/demotions we can transfer these measures to the current Siemens system and an imagined decentralized version of the current Siemens system.

Looking at \cref{sec:comp:decentralizedVScentralized} there is an advantage in scalability when running a decentralized solution compared to a centralized. This is underlined by the improvement in regulation cycle time of the decentralized solution compared to the centralized solution. The improvement of the scalability of the regulation cycle time comes at the price of the chance that the regulation may be performed on cached data.

Decentralizing the current Siemens system will enable improvements on other areas than regulation cycle time. By removing the centralized Park Pilots and the Wind Power Supervisor of the current Siemens solution the regulation of turbines, data storage and external communication of these must be decentralized and placed in the turbines themselves. This requires the use of software components that are able to handle regulation of turbines, data storage and external communication in a fashion such that if a turbine failure occurs other turbines can increase production to make up for the missing power production, provide access to the data collected on the failing turbine and handle external communication the failing turbine may have been handling. This increases the availability of the wind farm compared to the current Siemens system.
