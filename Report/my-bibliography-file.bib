abstract={A 2001 IBM manifesto observed that a looming software complexity crisis -caused by applications and environments that number into the tens of millions of lines of code - threatened to halt progress in computing. The manifesto noted the almost impossible difficulty of managing current and planned computing systems, which require integrating several heterogeneous environments into corporate-wide computing systems that extend into the Internet. Autonomic computing, perhaps the most attractive approach to solving this problem, creates systems that can manage themselves when given high-level objectives from administrators. Systems manage themselves according to an administrator's goals. New components integrate as effortlessly as a new cell establishes itself in the human body. These ideas are not science fiction, but elements of the grand challenge to create self-managing computing systems.},

  abstract = {Dynamic load balancing is essential for improving the overall utilization of resources and in turn to improve the system performance. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid dynamic load balancing algorithm. We discuss our efforts on empirical evaluation of the same and justify its effectiveness in a typical distributed setup. Addressing the key issues in the design of such an algorithm, we also propose two new algorithms for supernode selection in a cluster. Further, we analyze the performance of algorithm under different cluster configurations, different load scenarios, and different network topologies. Our experimental results show that the hybrid algorithm potentially outperforms the classical centralized and decentralized approaches for the design of a load balancing algorithm.},

title={Distributed Selfish Load Balancing},
journal={SIAM Journal on Computing},
volume={37},
number={4},
pages={1163-19},
note={Copyright - Copyright] © 2007 Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics; Last updated - 2012-01-30},
abstract={Suppose that a set of $m$ tasks are to be shared as equally as possible among a set of $n$ resources. A game-theoretic mechanism to find a suitable allocation is to associate each task with a "selfish agent" and require each agent to select a resource, with the cost of a resource being the number of agents that select it. Agents would then be expected to migrate from overloaded to underloaded resources, until the allocation becomes balanced. Recent work has studied the question of how this can take place within a distributed setting in which agents migrate selfishly without any centralized control. In this paper we discuss a natural protocol for the agents which combines the following desirable features: It can be implemented in a strongly distributed setting, uses no central control, and has good convergence properties. For $m \gg n$, the system becomes approximately balanced (an $\epsilon$-Nash equilibrium) in expected time $O(\log \log m)$. We show using a martingale technique that the process converges to a perfectly balanced allocation in expected time $O(\log \log m + n^4)$. We also give a lower bound of $\Omega(\max\{\log \log m, n\})$ for the convergence time.},

pages={979-993}, 
abstract={Dynamic load balancing strategies for minimizing the execution time of single applications running in parallel on multicomputer systems are discussed. Dynamic load balancing (DLB) is essential for the efficient use of highly parallel systems when solving non-uniform problems with unpredictable load estimates. With the evolution of more highly parallel systems, centralized DLB approaches which make use of a high degree of knowledge become less feasible due to the load balancing communication overhead. Five DLB strategies are presented which illustrate the tradeoff between 1) knowledge - the accuracy of each balancing decision, and 2) overhead - the amount of added processing and communication incurred by the balancing process. All five strategies have been implemented on an Inter iPSC/2 hypercube},

NoSQL database which breaks the shackles of RDBMS is becoming the focus of attention. In this paper, the principles and implementation mechanisms of Auto-Sharding in MongoDB database are firstly presented, then an improved algorithm based on the frequency of data operation is proposed in order to solve the problem of uneven distribution of data in auto-sharding. The improved balancing strategy can effectively balance the data among shards, and improve the cluster's concurrent reading and writing performance.},

abstract={This paper is trying to comment on the various NoSQL (Not only Structured Query Language) systems and to make a comparison (using multiple criteria) between them. The NoSQL databases were created as a mean to offer high performance (both in terms of speed and size) and high availability at the price of loosing the ACID (Atomic, Consistent, Isolated, Durable) trait of the traditional databases in exchange with keeping a weaker BASE (Basic Availability, Soft state, Eventual consistency) feature. Remains to be seen which of the multiple solutions created since the official appearance of the NoSQL concept (which was defined in 1998 and reintroduced in 2009, around which moment several NoSQL solutions emerged; at the present moment there are known over 120 such solutions) are really delivering on these promises of higher performance (although several of them are already used with very good results).},
