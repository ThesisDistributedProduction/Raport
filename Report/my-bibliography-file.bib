abstract={A 2001 IBM manifesto observed that a looming software complexity crisis -caused by applications and environments that number into the tens of millions of lines of code - threatened to halt progress in computing. The manifesto noted the almost impossible difficulty of managing current and planned computing systems, which require integrating several heterogeneous environments into corporate-wide computing systems that extend into the Internet. Autonomic computing, perhaps the most attractive approach to solving this problem, creates systems that can manage themselves when given high-level objectives from administrators. Systems manage themselves according to an administrator's goals. New components integrate as effortlessly as a new cell establishes itself in the human body. These ideas are not science fiction, but elements of the grand challenge to create self-managing computing systems.},

In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid dynamic load balancing algorithm. We discuss our efforts on empirical evaluation of the same and justify its effectiveness in a typical distributed setup. Addressing the key issues in the design of such an algorithm, we also propose two new algorithms for supernode selection in a cluster. Further, we analyze the performance of algorithm under different cluster configurations, different load scenarios, and different network topologies. Our experimental results show that the hybrid algorithm potentially outperforms the classical centralized and decentralized approaches for the design of a load balancing algorithm.},

note={Copyright - Copyright] © 2007 Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics; Last updated - 2012-01-30},
abstract={Suppose that a set of $m$ tasks are to be shared as equally as possible among a set of $n$ resources. A game-theoretic mechanism to find a suitable allocation is to associate each task with a "selfish agent" and require each agent to select a resource, with the cost of a resource being the number of agents that select it. Agents would then be expected to migrate from overloaded to underloaded resources, until the allocation becomes balanced. Recent work has studied the question of how this can take place within a distributed setting in which agents migrate selfishly without any centralized control. In this paper we discuss a natural protocol for the agents which combines the following desirable features: It can be implemented in a strongly distributed setting, uses no central control, and has good convergence properties. For $m \gg n$, the system becomes approximately balanced (an $\epsilon$-Nash equilibrium) in expected time $O(\log \log m)$. We show using a martingale technique that the process converges to a perfectly balanced allocation in expected time $O(\log \log m + n^4)$. We also give a lower bound of $\Omega(\max\{\log \log m, n\})$ for the convergence time.},

abstract={Dynamic load balancing strategies for minimizing the execution time of single applications running in parallel on multicomputer systems are discussed. Dynamic load balancing (DLB) is essential for the efficient use of highly parallel systems when solving non-uniform problems with unpredictable load estimates. With the evolution of more highly parallel systems, centralized DLB approaches which make use of a high degree of knowledge become less feasible due to the load balancing communication overhead. Five DLB strategies are presented which illustrate the tradeoff between 1) knowledge - the accuracy of each balancing decision, and 2) overhead - the amount of added processing and communication incurred by the balancing process. All five strategies have been implemented on an Inter iPSC/2 hypercube},

title={Ant colony optimization for routing and load-balancing: survey and new directions}, 
year={2003}, 
month={Sept}, 
volume={33}, 
number={5}, 
pages={560-572}, 
abstract={Although an ant is a simple creature, collectively a colony of ants performs useful tasks such as finding the shortest path to a food source and sharing this information with other ants by depositing pheromone. In the field of ant colony optimization (ACO), models of collective intelligence of ants are transformed into useful optimization techniques that find applications in computer networking. In this survey, the problem-solving paradigm of ACO is explicated and compared to traditional routing algorithms along the issues of routing information, routing overhead and adaptivity. The contributions of this survey include 1) providing a comparison and critique of the state-of-the-art approaches for mitigating stagnation (a major problem in many ACO algorithms), 2) surveying and comparing three major research in applying ACO in routing and load-balancing, and 3) discussing new directions and identifying open problems. The approaches for mitigating stagnation discussed include: evaporation, aging, pheromone smoothing and limiting, privileged pheromone laying and pheromone-heuristic control. The survey on ACO in routing/load-balancing includes comparison and critique of ant-based control and its ramifications, AntNet and its extensions, as well as ASGA and SynthECA. Discussions on new directions include an ongoing work of the authors in applying multiple ant colony optimization in load-balancing.},

abstract = "Mixed-machine heterogeneous computing (HC) environments utilize a distributed suite of different high-performance machines, interconnected with high-speed links, to perform different computationally intensive applications that have diverse computational requirements. \{HC\} environments are well suited to meet the computational demands of large, diverse groups of tasks. The problem of optimally mapping (defined as matching and scheduling) these tasks onto the machines of a distributed \{HC\} environment has been shown, in general, to be NP-complete, requiring the development of heuristic techniques. Selecting the best heuristic to use in a given environment, however, remains a difficult problem, because comparisons are often clouded by different underlying assumptions in the original study of each heuristic. Therefore, a collection of 11 heuristics from the literature has been selected, adapted, implemented, and analyzed under one set of common assumptions. It is assumed that the heuristics derive a mapping statically (i.e., off-line). It is also assumed that a metatask (i.e., a set of independent, noncommunicating tasks) is being mapped and that the goal is to minimize the total execution time of the metatask. The 11 heuristics examined are Opportunistic Load Balancing, Minimum Execution Time, Minimum Completion Time, Min–min, Max–min, Duplex, Genetic Algorithm, Simulated Annealing, Genetic Simulated Annealing, Tabu, and A*. This study provides one even basis for comparison and insights into circumstances where one technique will out-perform another. The evaluation procedure is specified, the heuristics are defined, and then comparison results are discussed. It is shown that for the cases studied here, the relatively simple Min–min heuristic performs well in comparison to the other techniques. ",

Remains to be seen which of the multiple solutions created since the official appearance of the NoSQL concept (which was defined in 1998 and reintroduced in 2009, around which moment several NoSQL solutions emerged; at the present moment there are known over 120 such solutions) are really delivering on these promises of higher performance (although several of them are already used with very good results).},
