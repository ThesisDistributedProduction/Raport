title={The vision of autonomic computing}, 
year={2003}, 
month={Jan}, 
volume={36}, 
number={1}, 
pages={41-50}, 
abstract={A 2001 IBM manifesto observed that a looming software complexity crisis -caused by applications and environments that number into the tens of millions of lines of code - threatened to halt progress in computing. The manifesto noted the almost impossible difficulty of managing current and planned computing systems, which require integrating several heterogeneous environments into corporate-wide computing systems that extend into the Internet. Autonomic computing, perhaps the most attractive approach to solving this problem, creates systems that can manage themselves when given high-level objectives from administrators. Systems manage themselves according to an administrator's goals. New components integrate as effortlessly as a new cell establishes itself in the human body. These ideas are not science fiction, but elements of the grand challenge to create self-managing computing systems.},

abstract = {Spanner is Google's scalable, multiversion, globally distributed, and synchronously replicated database. It is the first system to distribute data at global scale and support externally-consistent distributed transactions. This article describes how Spanner is structured, its feature set, the rationale underlying various design decisions, and a novel time API that exposes clock uncertainty. This API and its implementation are critical to supporting external consistency and a variety of powerful features: nonblocking reads in the past, lock-free snapshot transactions, and atomic schema changes, across all of Spanner.

year={2012}, 
month={July}, 
pages={851-854}, 
abstract={With the rapid development of the Internet Web 2.0 technology, the demands of large-scale distributed service and storage in cloud computing have brought great challenges to traditional relational database. NoSQL database which breaks the shackles of RDBMS is becoming the focus of attention. In this paper, the principles and implementation mechanisms of Auto-Sharding in MongoDB database are firstly presented, then an improved algorithm based on the frequency of data operation is proposed in order to solve the problem of uneven distribution of data in auto-sharding. The improved balancing strategy can effectively balance the data among shards, and improve the cluster's concurrent reading and writing performance.},

year={2011},

pages={363-366}, 
abstract={With the development of the Internet and cloud computing, there need databases to be able to store and process big data effectively, demand for high-performance when reading and writing, so the traditional relational database is facing many new challenges. Especially in large scale and high-concurrency applications, such as search engines and SNS, using the relational database to store and query dynamic user data has appeared to be inadequate. In this case, NoSQL database created. This paper describes the background, basic characteristics, data model of NoSQL. In addition, this paper classifies NoSQL databases according to the CAP theorem. Finally, the mainstream NoSQL databases are separately described in detail, and extract some properties to help enterprises to choose NoSQL.},

year={2011}, 
month={June}, 
pages={1-5}, 
abstract={This paper is trying to comment on the various NoSQL (Not only Structured Query Language) systems and to make a comparison (using multiple criteria) between them. The NoSQL databases were created as a mean to offer high performance (both in terms of speed and size) and high availability at the price of loosing the ACID (Atomic, Consistent, Isolated, Durable) trait of the traditional databases in exchange with keeping a weaker BASE (Basic Availability, Soft state, Eventual consistency) feature. Remains to be seen which of the multiple solutions created since the official appearance of the NoSQL concept (which was defined in 1998 and reintroduced in 2009, around which moment several NoSQL solutions emerged; at the present moment there are known over 120 such solutions) are really delivering on these promises of higher performance (although several of them are already used with very good results).},
