abstract={A 2001 IBM manifesto observed that a looming software complexity crisis -caused by applications and environments that number into the tens of millions of lines of code - threatened to halt progress in computing. The manifesto noted the almost impossible difficulty of managing current and planned computing systems, which require integrating several heterogeneous environments into corporate-wide computing systems that extend into the Internet. Autonomic computing, perhaps the most attractive approach to solving this problem, creates systems that can manage themselves when given high-level objectives from administrators. Systems manage themselves according to an administrator's goals. New components integrate as effortlessly as a new cell establishes itself in the human body. These ideas are not science fiction, but elements of the grand challenge to create self-managing computing systems.},

In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid dynamic load balancing algorithm. We discuss our efforts on empirical evaluation of the same and justify its effectiveness in a typical distributed setup. Addressing the key issues in the design of such an algorithm, we also propose two new algorithms for supernode selection in a cluster. Further, we analyze the performance of algorithm under different cluster configurations, different load scenarios, and different network topologies. Our experimental results show that the hybrid algorithm potentially outperforms the classical centralized and decentralized approaches for the design of a load balancing algorithm.},

abstract={Suppose that a set of $m$ tasks are to be shared as equally as possible among a set of $n$ resources. A game-theoretic mechanism to find a suitable allocation is to associate each task with a "selfish agent" and require each agent to select a resource, with the cost of a resource being the number of agents that select it. Agents would then be expected to migrate from overloaded to underloaded resources, until the allocation becomes balanced. Recent work has studied the question of how this can take place within a distributed setting in which agents migrate selfishly without any centralized control. In this paper we discuss a natural protocol for the agents which combines the following desirable features: It can be implemented in a strongly distributed setting, uses no central control, and has good convergence properties. For $m \gg n$, the system becomes approximately balanced (an $\epsilon$-Nash equilibrium) in expected time $O(\log \log m)$. We show using a martingale technique that the process converges to a perfectly balanced allocation in expected time $O(\log \log m + n^4)$. We also give a lower bound of $\Omega(\max\{\log \log m, n\})$ for the convergence time.},

abstract={Although an ant is a simple creature, collectively a colony of ants performs useful tasks such as finding the shortest path to a food source and sharing this information with other ants by depositing pheromone. In the field of ant colony optimization (ACO), models of collective intelligence of ants are transformed into useful optimization techniques that find applications in computer networking. In this survey, the problem-solving paradigm of ACO is explicated and compared to traditional routing algorithms along the issues of routing information, routing overhead and adaptivity. The contributions of this survey include 1) providing a comparison and critique of the state-of-the-art approaches for mitigating stagnation (a major problem in many ACO algorithms), 2) surveying and comparing three major research in applying ACO in routing and load-balancing, and 3) discussing new directions and identifying open problems. The approaches for mitigating stagnation discussed include: evaporation, aging, pheromone smoothing and limiting, privileged pheromone laying and pheromone-heuristic control. The survey on ACO in routing/load-balancing includes comparison and critique of ant-based control and its ramifications, AntNet and its extensions, as well as ASGA and SynthECA. Discussions on new directions include an ongoing work of the authors in applying multiple ant colony optimization in load-balancing.},

abstract = {Mixed-machine heterogeneous computing (HC) environments utilize a distributed suite of different high-performance machines, interconnected with high-speed links, to perform different computationally intensive applications that have diverse computational requirements. \{HC\} environments are well suited to meet the computational demands of large, diverse groups of tasks. The problem of optimally mapping (defined as matching and scheduling) these tasks onto the machines of a distributed \{HC\} environment has been shown, in general, to be NP-complete, requiring the development of heuristic techniques. Selecting the best heuristic to use in a given environment, however, remains a difficult problem, because comparisons are often clouded by different underlying assumptions in the original study of each heuristic. Therefore, a collection of 11 heuristics from the literature has been selected, adapted, implemented, and analyzed under one set of common assumptions. It is assumed that the heuristics derive a mapping statically (i.e., off-line). It is also assumed that a metatask (i.e., a set of independent, noncommunicating tasks) is being mapped and that the goal is to minimize the total execution time of the metatask. The 11 heuristics examined are Opportunistic Load Balancing, Minimum Execution Time, Minimum Completion Time, Min–min, Max–min, Duplex, Genetic Algorithm, Simulated Annealing, Genetic Simulated Annealing, Tabu, and A*. This study provides one even basis for comparison and insights into circumstances where one technique will out-perform another. The evaluation procedure is specified, the heuristics are defined, and then comparison results are discussed. It is shown that for the cases studied here, the relatively simple Min–min heuristic performs well in comparison to the other techniques.},

ABSTRACT = {Advances in Web technology and the proliferation of mobile devices and sensors connected to the Internet have resulted in immense processing and storage requirements. Cloud computing has emerged as a paradigm that promises to meet these requirements. This work focuses on the storage aspect of cloud computing, specifically on data management in cloud environments. Traditional relational databases were designed in a different hardware and software era and are facing challenges in meeting the performance and scale requirements of Big Data. NoSQL and NewSQL data stores present themselves as alternatives that can handle huge volume of data. Because of the large number and diversity of existing NoSQL and NewSQL solutions, it is difficult to comprehend the domain and even more challenging to choose an appropriate solution for a specific task. Therefore, this paper reviews NoSQL and NewSQL solutions with the objective of: (1) providing a perspective in the field, (2) providing guidance to practitioners and researchers to choose the appropriate data store, and (3) identifying challenges and opportunities in the field. Specifically, the most prominent solutions are compared focusing on data models, querying, scaling, and security related capabilities. Features driving the ability to scale read requests and write requests, or scaling data storage are investigated, in particular partitioning, replication, consistency, and concurrency control. Furthermore, use cases and scenarios in which NoSQL and NewSQL data stores have been used are discussed and the suitability of various solutions for different sets of applications is examined. Consequently, this study has identified challenges in the field, including the immense diversity and inconsistency of terminologies, limited documentation, sparse comparison and benchmarking criteria, and nonexistence of standardized query languages.},

abstract={This paper is trying to comment on the various NoSQL (Not only Structured Query Language) systems and to make a comparison (using multiple criteria) between them. The NoSQL databases were created as a mean to offer high performance (both in terms of speed and size) and high availability at the price of loosing the ACID (Atomic, Consistent, Isolated, Durable) trait of the traditional databases in exchange with keeping a weaker BASE (Basic Availability, Soft state, Eventual consistency) feature. Remains to be seen which of the multiple solutions created since the official appearance of the NoSQL concept (which was defined in 1998 and reintroduced in 2009, around which moment several NoSQL solutions emerged; at the present moment there are known over 120 such solutions) are really delivering on these promises of higher performance (although several of them are already used with very good results).},

abstract = "At the moment, the control ability of wind farms is a prime research concern for the grid integration of large wind farms, due to their required active role in the power system. This paper describes the on-going work of a research project, whose overall objective is to analyse and assess the possibilities for control of different wind farm concepts. The scope of this paper is the control of a wind farm made up exclusively of doubly fed induction generators. The paper addresses the design and implementation issues of such a controller and focuses on the ability of the wind farm control strategy to regulate the wind farm power production to the reference power ordered by the system operators. The presented wind farm control has a hierarchical structure with both a central control level and a local control level. The central wind farm control level controls the power production of the whole farm by sending out reference power signals to each individual wind turbine, while the local wind turbine control level ensures that the reference power signal send by the central control level is reached. The performance of the control strategy is assessed and discussed by means of simulations illustrated both at the wind farm level and at each individual wind turbine level. "

abstract={Wind farms have been used on large scales to increase the amount of power produced while minimizing the interconnection costs to decrease the overall cost of energy. However placing these wind turbines in close proximity to one another has reduced the performance of wind turbines due to wake loss effects. By modeling wind turbines using actuator disk theory and modeling wakes using the PARK and Mosaic Tile wake models, two different optimization methods are used in this research to determine the ideal axial induction factor configuration in order to minimize wake loss effects to improve the overall performance of a wind farm. Lowering the axial induction factor allows for more wind to pass through the upstream wind turbines reducing the wake loss effects so that downwind turbines can produce more power. Through this research it has been shown that with the optimization of the axial induction factors a 4% to 6% increase in power can be obtained depending on the size of the wind farm, the turbine spacing, and the number of turbines controlled. Additionally comparisons are made to the wake loss effects observed at the Horns Rev wind farm as well as wind farm control experiments performed in a wind tunnel at the Energy research Center of the Netherlands. With this further study may be performed to extend the optimized axial induction factor configurations to determine optimized pitch and rotor speed control strategies.},

In this regard, the farm controller calculates the power reference signals for individual wind turbine controllers such that the sum of the power references tracks the power demanded by a system operator. Moreover, the reference signals are determined to reduce the load acting on wind turbines at low frequencies. Therefore, a trade-off is made for load and power control, which is formulated as an optimization problem. Afterwards, the optimization problem for the wind farm modeled as a bilinear control system is solved using an approximation method. "
