\chapter{Experiments}
The goal of this project was not only to build a control system that provides both scalability and availability, but also to compare it to the current solution by Siemens Windpower. 
In order to evaluate the system, we have created the experiments in the following sections.

%\begin{enumerate} [label={\arabic*.}, ref=\textit{\arabic*}]
%	\item \label{PS:Q:1} How can we best re-implement the current Siemens system (\cref{sec:SiemensCase}) as a system where the Wind Park Supervisor and the Park Pilots are decentralized?
%	\item \label{PS:Q:2} Can we, with the new decentralized solution, reduce the current regulation cycle time of 150 ms?
%	\item \label{PS:Q:3} Can we create a solution that scales so the number of turbines does not impact the regulation cycle time?
%	\item \label{PS:Q:4} Can we create a solution where removing one or more nodes from the system at runtime does not cause system failure?
%\end{enumerate}

\section{Scalability Experiments}
Scalability is by Bondi\cite{Bondi:2000:CSI:350391.350432} defined as the systems ability to accommodate an increasing number of elements or objects, to process growing volumes of work gracefully, and/or to be susceptible to enlargement. 

The experiments below are engineered to show how the number of turbines affect performance characteristics parameters.

\begin{itemize}
	\item CPU load
	\item Memory consumption
	\item Network utilization
	\item Number of cache misses
	\item Cycle time????
\end{itemize}
