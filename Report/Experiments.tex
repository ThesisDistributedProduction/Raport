The goal of this project is not only to build a control system that provides both scalability and availability, but also to compare it to the current solution by Siemens Windpower. 
To evaluate the new decentralized system, the experiments in the following sections where created. 
The experiments are grouped by in relation to the problem statements proposed in \cref{sec:problemStatement}.

The experiments are performed using 3 laptops connected using a Gbit(IEEE 802.3ab) Ethernet router with IGMP support(see \cref{appendix:HardwareSpecification}), The laptops are howerver only using 100Mb(IEEE 802.3u) network adapters.
One laptop is being used to capture test data and the others are running a number of turbines to generate network traffic.
All test are run with CPU utilization on average below 90\% and network adapters are likewise monitored to ensure they are neither overloaded doing experiment runs
Monitoring these to parameters are essential to getting usable test results, if the processor or network adapter is overloaded packages will not be sent sufficiently fast and will impact cycletime in a way that would never happen when running just one instance.

Every experiment is run at least X \todo{Set correct value for X} times 

\section{Experiments: \ref{PS:Q:Feasibility}}

The \ref{PS:Q:Feasibility} question asks if it is possible to re-implement the current system at Siemens Wind Power as a decentralized system. The following experiment aims to investigate if the proposed decentralized system can perform the operations that the current centralized system at Siemens Wind Power is able to perform. More specifically the experiments aims to investigate if the proposed decentralized system is able to regulate the power production of each turbine in order to maintain the global power production goal.
The experiment has the following procedure:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Start the system with 100 turbines.
	\item Start the graphical interface described in \cref{sec:graphicalInterface}.
	\item Observe that the global setpoint and the global production line on the graphical interface match.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Experiments: \ref{PS:Q:Availability}}
The \ref{PS:Q:Availability} question asks if the proposed decentralized system is able to continue its functions even though nodes are removed from the system at runtime.
The proposed decentralized system should be able to continue maintaining the global setpoint of the park even if some turbines become unavailable, this of course assumes that available capacity is present in the park.

The below experiment is repeated with a N failing turbines
The experiment has the following procedure:
$N = \failingTurbineNumbers$
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Start the system with 100 turbines.
	\item Make sure the system is stable.
	\item Kill N nodes.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item did the system discover the failed node within a 150ms timeframe?
		\item did the system adjust the setpoints for all turbines to maintain the global setpoint?
	\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}


\section{Experiments: \ref{PS:Q:Performance}}
Scalability is by Bondi\cite{Bondi:2000:CSI:350391.350432} defined as \textit{the systems ability to accommodate an increasing number of elements or objects, to process growing volumes of work gracefully, and/or to be susceptible to enlargement}.

The \ref{PS:Q:Performance} question asks if the proposed decentralized system is able to scale with the number of turbines in the system. The experiments that investigate this question has been split into two part. \newline

Part 1 aims to investigate the anticorrelation between regulation time and cache read count in the proposed decentralized system. This is relevant because changing the regulation time may have an impact on the number of cache reads. Choosing a regulation time that has a low number of cache read count for part 2 of the experiments will make it easier to identify how scaling up the number of turbines will affect cache read count. \newline

Part 2 aims to investigate the impact on regulation time and cache read count when the number of turbines are scaled up in the proposed decentralized system. \newline

\subsection{Part 1: Regulation time and the impact on cache read count}
The experiment below are made to show how the regulation time affect the cache read count in the decentralized system described in \cref{cha:decentralizedSystem}. 
The experiments are performed with \testCycletimeNumbers ~cycle times.  

The following procedure is used each time the experiment is performed:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Start the system with a cycle time of N ms and 21 turbines.
	\item Make sure the system is stable.
	\item Start logging the reported regulation run time and cache read count.
	\item Stop logging after \experiemntRunTime.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Part 2: Number of turbines and their impact on regulation time and cache read count}
The experiment below are made to show how the number of turbines affect the regulation cycle in the decentralized system described in \cref{cha:decentralizedSystem}.

The experiments are performed with \testTurbineNumbers ~turbines. Besides turbines we are also going to modify ''Data Wait Time Frame'' witch is a constant that defines the time a turbine controller will wait for new updates before considering the other turbines offline and unavailable, i.e. regulation speed.

The test system is expected to be running only one instance in a real life implementation, therefore the test machine will only run one instance and the support machines will run the rest generating system load.
The experiment is done with a variating N number of online turbines.

The following procedure is used each time the experiment is performed:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Start the system with N turbines.
	\item Make sure the system is stable.
	\item Start logging the reported regulation run time and cache read count.
	\item Stop logging after \experiemntRunTime.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Experiments: \ref{PS:Q:Scalability}}
Question \ref{PS:Q:Scalability} of \cref{sec:problemStatement} asks how the proposed decentralized system compares to the existing centralized system\cref{cha:existingSystem}) at Siemens Wind Power with regards to a number of parameters.
The experiments below aims to show how the number of turbines and regulation speed affect the regulation algorithm, memory consumption and Network traffic.
Each of these parameters behave differently when centralized compared to decentralized as seen in \cref{fig:timingCentralVSDecentral} the decentralized system does not wait for new data before doing calculations. Because of this the proposed decentralized version has a extra parameter which indicate how much data was updated before the calculation started.

\begin{figure}[b]

	\input{figures/tikz/timingDiagramDecntral}
	\caption{Centralized vs decentralized regulation time}
	\label{fig:timingCentralVSDecentral}
\end{figure}

	The centralized version is split into two applications a client and a server.
	The aim is to compare the regulation time, therefore the client side of the application is not measured. This means that the decentralized version is at a slight disadvantage.
	The following procedure is used each time the experiment is done, the procedure is done with N simulated turbines for both :

\begin{minipage}{\textwidth}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Start the system with N turbines.
		\item Make sure the system is stable.
		\item Start logging:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Reported regulation run time (Central only, Decentralized is reused)
			\item Memory and Bandwidth
		\end{itemize}
		\item Stop logging after \experiemntRunTime.
		\end{enumerate}
\end{minipage}
