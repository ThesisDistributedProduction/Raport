\chapter{Load balancing}

When dealing with redundant distributed systems, there exists more than one node capable of doing some work.
In such a system the workload needs to be distributed and balanced across all nodes.
This is done using a load balancer with a node balancing algorithm and some performance optimising features.

A node balancer is a service witch distributes incoming requests, among the services registered on the network.
The distribution is based on different policies like dividing packages or picking the one with most free CPU capacity.
The load balancer could be a single point of failure and there should therefore always be more than one.

In this solution the load balancer needs to balance external connections to different protocols like HTTP and Modbus, however a solution witch can be extended to any restful protocol is needed. Also balancing of node roles depending on the amount incoming traffic on different interfaces will be needed.
Load balancers can also provide different features like bundling requests, security, discovering bad nodes and caching (Squid). This can offload the servers behind.

The following requirements to the system exists:
\begin{description}
	\item[Robustness]
	\item[Protocol flexible]
	\item[Distributed component] Must be a distributed component
\end{description}

Preferred features
\begin{itemize}
	\item support TCP Handoffs (for non restful applications)
\end{itemize}

\section{Levels of balancing}
\begin{description}
	\item[OSI 3] Network/IP %google says network layer LVS says transport layer
	\item[OSI 4] Network/IP
	\item[OSI 7] {Application level, like http balancing, allows balancing strategies based on url and user location.}
\end{description}

What we would like is a transport layer protocol.
\cite{Ludwig:SwarmIntelligenceGridLoadBalancing} Implements a particle swam based algorithm, and discuses quality parameters.

\section{Existing solutions}
\begin{description}
	\item[Linux Virtual Server: IPVS] Is implemented in the linux kernal version 2.4 and 2.6. Works at the IP level. Useed byt big sites sourceforge.net, layer 3.
	\item[Google Compute Engine: Load Balancer]: Proprietary. layer 3 and 7.
