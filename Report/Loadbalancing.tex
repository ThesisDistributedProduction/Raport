%Having redundant systems provides a number of favourable traits like scalability and availability.

Resource management is a key activity in a distributed decentralised system.
A decentralised system consists of a number of nodes with various resources available. 
Resources like: Memory, Processing time, Network bandwidth, Hard drive I/O operations and more. 

Resource management should be fair, this means the nodes should have the workload distributed as evenly as possible.
There are different ways to handle this, some systems are able to split a single task up in equally large chunks for each node, in the Siemens case this is similar to the control algorithm that every turbine controller will need to run.
In a system where the tasks can be split evenly among the nodes, resource management logic might not be need as the system achieves a fair distribution by design, needless to say this can result in a much simpler design because of fewer components while avoid overhead due to resource management control algorithms. %and data aggregation functionality?
Others have many different tasks that can run independently of each other in the Siemens case this will be handling requests from users and secondary systems running outside the wind farm.
As stated the Siemens case is a system in which both situations are present, witch means a resource management logic is needed.

\section{Load Balancing}
Software responsible for handling resource management is called a load balancer.
Load balancers come in different complexity and with the ability to manage resource in different ways. From naively assigning clients with a round robin based algorithm to distributing connections based on resource monitoring. Some Load balancers require client and or server integration some function completely independently.

Different load balancing methods will are here briefly described:
%Load balancing for large systems can be split in tiers.
\paragraph{DNS based load balancing} %A alternative better name exists lookup next week
is a load balancer built into the DNS service, it distributes load in a round robin manner as well as using region knowledge of where the request was revived from \cite{Amazon:Route53}. DNS based load balancing is among the most scalable solutions that does not need any special configuration of either client nor server. However is does not provide any monitoring of server performance parameters, and once the DNS lookup is over the service does not play any role in load balancing related to one that specific client until the DNS cache is refreshed. This type of loadbalancing is not applicable since 

At a lower tier it could be machine level based on performance parameters like \cite{zhang2000linuxVirtualServer}, and finally application level based on the content of the request \cite{Citation is missing and I need to find it}.
There exists a lot of solution specific load balancers.
A node balancer is a service witch distributes incoming requests, among the services registered on the network.
The distribution is based on different policies like dividing packages or picking the one with most free CPU capacity.
The load balancer could be a single point of failure, it should for this reason always have one or more backups as seen in \cref{fig:loadBalancingSetup}.
The load balancer monitors the real servers and only parses on requests to running servers.
A secondary needs to monitor the primary load balancer and step in if it stops responding.
This can be done using a virtual private IP, which is the address for all incoming requests. Also there exists solutions witch does all this in a completely distributed manner avoiding having a central server as load balancer \cite{Some cite I ahven't found yet}, this is even in some cases extended to include the clients in the act of load balancing \cite{SOme cite to netflic eureka balancer}.

	}
\end{figure}

In this solution the load balancer needs to balance external connections to different protocols like HTTP and Modbus, however a solution witch can be extended to any restful protocol is needed.
Also balancing of node roles depending on the amount incoming traffic on different interfaces will be needed.
Should all this be done automatically or is it better to define this manually???

Load balances can provide various features, related to offloading the real server and node management. % SSL decryprtion, caching, authentication, ...

\section{Levels of balancing}
\begin{description}
	\item[??] DDNS / Round robin DNS
	\item[OSI 3] Network/IP %google says network layer LVS says transport layer
	\item[OSI 4] Network/IP
	\item[OSI 7] {Application level, like http balancing, allows balancing strategies based on url and user location.}
\end{description}

What we would like is a transport layer protocol.

Implements a particle swam based and an ant based algorithm. 
It discuses quality parameters.
It compares with a version using distributed knowledge (SBA State Broadcast Algorithm)
