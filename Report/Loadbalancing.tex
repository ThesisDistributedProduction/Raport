\chapter{Load balancing}

When dealing with redundant distributed systems, there often exists more than one node capable of doing some work.
However one node is not able to handle the workload in a satisfying manner.
This means the nodes must cooperate and balance out the workload.
This is done using a load balancer with a node balancing algorithm.

In this solution the load balancer needs to balance external connections to different protocols like HTTP and Modbus, however a solution witch can be extended to any restful protocol is needed. Also balancing of node roles depending on incoming traffic will be needed.


The following requirements to the system exists:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Robustness
	\item Protocol flexible
	\item Must be a distributed component
\end{itemize}
