Wind energy is widely recognized as one of the most cost efficient renewable energy sources. 
%Because of this wind farms are increasing in size and power production. 
%Because of this wind farm size and power production is increasing.
Because of this wind farm size and power production steadily increases.
%, in order to accommodate the rising need for energy from renewable sources. 
%The number of turbines in a single wind farm can reach more than 500.
Control of the increasing number of turbines in wind farms is becoming problematic.
%
The traditional hierarchical control approach with central control points responsible for regulation of turbine power production does not scale well with the number of turbines, and introduce single points of failure.
%
This thesis aims to take a new approach to control of wind farms.
%
In place of the hierarchical control approach the aim is to decentralize the control of turbines.
%
%This is done by letting each turbine regulate it's own power production in accordance with the power production of all other turbines in the wind farm.
This is achieved by letting the turbines regulate power production themselves while cooperating to reach the power production goal of the wind farm.
%In place of the hierarchical control approach the aim is to decentralize the control of turbines in a wind farm by letting each turbine control it's own power production in accordance with the power production of all other turbines in the wind farm.
%In place of the hierarchical control approach this thesis aim to let every turbine control itself in accordance with the power production of other turbines, in effect decentralizing the control of the wind farm.
Decentralizing the control of turbines will increase the scalability of the wind farm as increasing the number of turbines will also increase the number of resources available to perform regulation of power production.
%
As well as increased scalability, decentralizing wind farm control will increase availability, as there no longer exist a single point in the farm that every turbine is dependent on.
